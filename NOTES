Fictional computer hardware design tool.

shell based simulation.

interacting with machine:

1. you can set the inputs before machine begins.
2. you can read the output at any time after machine begins.
3. you can start the machine.
4. you can stop the machine.
5. you can specify a clock input.  
6. you can take snapshots.

machine design:

1. you can save machine state.
2. you can link different machines.
3. you can place gates
4. you can place wiring.
5. you can perform testing.

User case 1:
User specifies some design from a sheet.


Design Language Specification:

>> load componentType componentName
>> load wire wireName deviceName0 pinName0 deviceName1 pinName1 >> DEPRECATED. use link instead

loads a component

componentTypes:

wire
transistor
power
ground
meter

componentName:

unique name

Wire is a unique case, as it must be constructed with at least two components; it cannot stand alone on its own. You may specify more than 2 components

You can specify multiple component names to create more than one

>> link deviceName pinName deviceName pinName
>> link pinName0 pinName1

if device has only 1 pin, then it is not necessary to specify pin name.

>> unlink pinName
>> unlink devieName pinName

disconnect the pin from any wire

>> save deviceName

fail if name already exists.

>> show
>> show deviceName

show shows the current canvas
show deviceName shows the device

>> unload
>> unload deviceName
unload removes everything from the current canvas
unload device removes some deviceID or no-op if it doesn't exist 

Test Language Specification:

>> set inputID value
value:
high
low

>> verbose on
>> verbose off

>> run
>> run 1
run test. it can potentially run for a long time, so it needs to run on the background. or it may need timeouts. runs in a separate thread. if already running, then stop and run again. 
>> s
>> step
step 
>> show
show values at every wire
show 1 shows just current level. 
show 2 shows current level and one level down.
>> show device 1
start at device 1 and stay there

>> stop
stop (freeze) the machine, if it is running.
